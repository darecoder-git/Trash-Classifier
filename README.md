# Trash-Classifier-app

Welcome to the Trash Classifier app  repository! This project aims to classify waste items into different categories using machine learning techniques. The model was developed and trained using Python on a dataset of images of trash.

The repository includes the code for a web application built with Streamlit that allows users to classify their own trash items by uploading an image. The application loads a pre-trained model that was trained earlier and saved for later use. The application also provides information about proper waste disposal for each category.

We hope that this project can contribute to the effort of promoting sustainable waste management practices and reducing the negative impact of waste on the environment. Feel free to use the code and application for your own projects or as a starting point for further development
